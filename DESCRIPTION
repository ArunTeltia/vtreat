Description: vtreat is a package that treats variables so that models can be used in production. Common problems vtreat defends against: NA, too many categorical values, rare categorical values, new categorical values (levels seen during application, but not during training).   vtreatList(treatments,data.frame) should be used as you would use model.matrix.
