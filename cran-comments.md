## Test environments
* local OS X install, 3.2.2
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check --as-cran vtreat_0.5.17.tar.gz results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. 

There were two NOTEs:

* Maintainer: ‘John Mount <jmount@win-vector.com>’
* No repository set, so cyclic dependency check skipped



## Downstream dependencies
I have also run R CMD check on downstream dependencies of vtreat
